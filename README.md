# Django Cloud Project
### _An online course app built with Django and IBM Cloud_

This repo contains the code for a [web app](https://sebastianrok.eu-de.mybluemix.net/onlinecourse/) built with Django as part of the Coursera IBM Course ***Developing Applications with SQL, Databases, and Django***. 

To the fellow students who aim to copy the code in this project over to their own: <br>
*please leave me a star, at least.* :)
